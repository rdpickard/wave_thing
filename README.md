Want to talk to the network of NOAA buoy's but don't want to parse the data. WAVE_THING is a gateway for you!

WAVE_THING acts as a HTTP gateway for translating the tabular data of the NOAA buoy API into JSON or XML. 

See it running [here](https://wave-thing.herokuapp.com/)

### WAVE_THING
WAVE_THING is a Python 3 application. To install Pyhton 3 if you don't already have it see [this guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) that covers the process for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

The access to WAVE_THING is through HTTP. It uses the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/) micro service to handle HTTP requests and responses. Installing Flask is taken care by the steps in the _To Run_ section of this document. It is pretty painless.

### To run:
```
pip install -r requirments.txt
python application.py
```

The gateway will now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

### To use:


To make a call against the NOAA data set the API path is 

```
/api/buoytalk/[buoy id]/[buoy data set]
```

The valid values for the `buoy data set` are defined on the [NOAA website](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/rt_data_access.shtml). 

_Note that not all buoys have all data sets available and WAVE_THING is not implementing all translations yet._

##### Command line example with CURL
```angular2html
curl -H "Accept: application/json"  http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/buoytalk/42001/spec
```

##### Programmatic example with Python 
```
import requests

# Which buoy and it's data I want
desired_buoy_id=42001
desired_buoy_data_set="txt"

# Make the request to the locally running instance of WAVE_THING
wave_thing_request = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/buoytalk/{buoy_id}/{buoy_data_set}".format(
    buoy_id=desired_buoy_id,
    buoy_data_set=desired_buoy_data_set
))

if wave_thing_request.status_code != 200:
    # Something went wrong
    print(wave_thing_request.text)
else:
    # Print the data!
    print(wave_thing_request.json())
```

Full documentation of the API in SWAGGER format is in the file docs/wave_thing_api.swagger.yaml. 

### Internet accessible WAVE_THING with AWS:

WAVE_THING will also run fine on AWS ElasticBeanStalk. Follow the steps on the AWS [documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-flask.html) to deploy on ElasticBeanstalk.
